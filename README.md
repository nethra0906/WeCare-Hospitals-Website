I developed a comprehensive hospital management website using HTML,CSS,React.js & CRUD to streamline hospital operations and enhance patient care. 
**Key features include:**

**Appointment Scheduling:** Online booking for patients.
**User-Friendly UI/UX:** Simple and modern design for ease of use.
**Emergency Button:** Enables immediate assistance by calling an ambulance or contacting a nurse.
**Nearby ER Locator:** Directs users to nearby emergency rooms via maps.
**360Â° Hospital View:** Offers a virtual tour of the hospital for prospective visitors.

This project aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce paperwork, and ensure data security within healthcare facilities.
